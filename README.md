# Li-Fi-Data-Transmission
This project demonstrates the use of Li-Fi technology to transmit data in a remote area. Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. It is a promising technology for providing high-speed data access in remote areas, as it does not require the use of radio waves or other wireless signals.
